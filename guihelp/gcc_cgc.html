<H2>Options for Code Generation Conventions</H2>

<A NAME="ixCFD"></A>
These machine-independent options control the interface conventions
used in code generation.
<P>

Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of <B>-ffoo</B> would be <B>-fno-foo</B>.  In the table below, only
one of the forms is listed---the one which is not the default.  You
can figure out the other form by either removing <B>no-</B> or adding
it.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-fbounds-check</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFE"></A>
For front-ends that support it, generate additional code to check that
indices used to access arrays are within the declared range.  This is
currently only supported by the Java and Fortran 77 front-ends, where
this option defaults to true and false respectively.
<DT><B>-ftrapv</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFF"></A>
This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction,
multiplication operations.
<DT><B>-fwrapv</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFG"></A>
This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic
overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around
using twos-complement representation.  This flag enables some optimizations
and disables other.  This option is enabled by default for the Java
front-end, as required by the Java language specification.
<DT><B>-fexceptions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFH"></A>
Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will generate frame
unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data
size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
specify this option, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will enable it by default for languages like
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> which normally require exception handling, and disable it for
languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need
to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
properly with exception handlers written in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.  You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs that don't
use exception handling.
<DT><B>-fnon-call-exceptions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFI"></A>
Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions.
Note that this requires platform-specific runtime support that does
not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows <I>trapping</I>
instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating
point instructions.  It does not allow exceptions to be thrown from
arbitrary signal handlers such as <TT>&quot;SIGALRM&quot;</TT>.
<DT><B>-funwind-tables</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFJ"></A>
Similar to <B>-fexceptions</B>, except that it will just generate any needed
static data, but will not affect the generated code in any other way.
You will normally not enable this option; instead, a language processor
that needs this handling would enable it on your behalf.
<DT><B>-fasynchronous-unwind-tables</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFK"></A>
Generate unwind table in dwarf2 format, if supported by target machine.  The
table is exact at each instruction boundary, so it can be used for stack
unwinding from asynchronous events (such as debugger or garbage collector).
<DT><B>-fpcc-struct-return</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFL"></A>
Return ``short'' <TT>&quot;struct&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;union&quot;</TT> values in memory like
longer ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less
efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability between
GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly
the Portable C Compiler (pcc).


<P>


The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
on the target configuration macros.


<P>


Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match
that of some integer type.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> code compiled with the <B>-fpcc-struct-return</B>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
<B>-freg-struct-return</B> switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
<DT><B>-freg-struct-return</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFM"></A>
Return <TT>&quot;struct&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;union&quot;</TT> values in registers when possible.
This is more efficient for small structures than
<B>-fpcc-struct-return</B>.


<P>


If you specify neither <B>-fpcc-struct-return</B> nor
<B>-freg-struct-return</B>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> defaults to whichever convention is
standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
defaults to <B>-fpcc-struct-return</B>, except on targets where <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is
the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the standard, and
we chose the more efficient register return alternative.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> code compiled with the <B>-freg-struct-return</B>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
<B>-fpcc-struct-return</B> switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
<DT><B>-fshort-enums</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFN"></A>
Allocate to an <TT>&quot;enum&quot;</TT> type only as many bytes as it needs for the
declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the <TT>&quot;enum&quot;</TT> type
will be equivalent to the smallest integer type which has enough room.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> the <B>-fshort-enums</B> switch causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
<DT><B>-fshort-double</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFO"></A>
Use the same size for <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT> as for <TT>&quot;float&quot;</TT>.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> the <B>-fshort-double</B> switch causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
<DT><B>-fshort-wchar</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFP"></A>
Override the underlying type for <B>wchar_t</B> to be <B>short
unsigned int</B> instead of the default for the target.  This option is
useful for building programs to run under <FONT SIZE="-1">WINE</FONT>.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> the <B>-fshort-wchar</B> switch causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
<DT><B>-fshared-data</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFQ"></A>
Requests that the data and non-<TT>&quot;const&quot;</TT> variables of this
compilation be shared data rather than private data.  The distinction
makes sense only on certain operating systems, where shared data is
shared between processes running the same program, while private data
exists in one copy per process.
<DT><B>-fno-common</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFR"></A>
In C, allocate even uninitialized global variables in the data section of the
object file, rather than generating them as common blocks.  This has the
effect that if the same variable is declared (without <TT>&quot;extern&quot;</TT>) in
two different compilations, you will get an error when you link them.
The only reason this might be useful is if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems which always work this way.
<DT><B>-fno-ident</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFS"></A>
Ignore the <B>#ident</B> directive.
<DT><B>-finhibit-size-directive</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFT"></A>
Don't output a <TT>&quot;.size&quot;</TT> assembler directive, or anything else that
would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the
two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This option is
used when compiling <I>crtstuff.c</I>; you should not need to use it
for anything else.
<DT><B>-fverbose-asm</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFU"></A>
Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while
debugging the compiler itself).


<P>


<B>-fno-verbose-asm</B>, the default, causes the
extra information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler
files.
<DT><B>-fpic</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFV"></A>
Generate position-independent code (<FONT SIZE="-1">PIC</FONT>) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (<FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT>).  The dynamic
loader resolves the <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>; it is part of the operating system).  If
the <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
<B>-fpic</B> does not work; in that case, recompile with <B>-fPIC</B>
instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the <FONT SIZE="-1">SPARC</FONT> and 32k
on the m68k and <FONT SIZE="-1">RS/6000</FONT>.  The 386 has no such limit.)


<P>


Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the 386, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> supports <FONT SIZE="-1">PIC</FONT> for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the <FONT SIZE="-1">IBM</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">RS/6000</FONT> is always
position-independent.
<DT><B>-fPIC</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFW"></A>
If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code,
suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the size of the
global offset table.  This option makes a difference on the m68k
and the <FONT SIZE="-1">SPARC</FONT>.


<P>


Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.
<DT><B>-fpie</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFX"></A>

<DT><B>-fPIE</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFY"></A>

These options are similar to <B>-fpic</B> and <B>-fPIC</B>, but
generated position independent code can be only linked into executables.
Usually these options are used when <B>-pie</B> <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> option will be
used during linking.
<DT><B>-ffixed-</B><I>reg</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixCFZ"></A>
Treat the register named <I>reg</I> as a fixed register; generated code
should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame
pointer or in some other fixed role).


<P>


<I>reg</I> must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
are machine-specific and are defined in the <TT>&quot;REGISTER_NAMES&quot;</TT>
macro in the machine description macro file.


<P>


This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.
<DT><B>-fcall-used-</B><I>reg</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixCGA"></A>
Treat the register named <I>reg</I> as an allocable register that is
clobbered by function calls.  It may be allocated for temporaries or
variables that do not live across a call.  Functions compiled this way
will not save and restore the register <I>reg</I>.


<P>


It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model will produce disastrous results.


<P>


This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.
<DT><B>-fcall-saved-</B><I>reg</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixCGB"></A>
Treat the register named <I>reg</I> as an allocable register saved by
functions.  It may be allocated even for temporaries or variables that
live across a call.  Functions compiled this way will save and restore
the register <I>reg</I> if they use it.


<P>


It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model will produce disastrous results.


<P>


A different sort of disaster will result from the use of this flag for
a register in which function values may be returned.


<P>


This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.
<DT><B>-fpack-struct</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCGC"></A>
Pack all structure members together without holes.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> the <B>-fpack-struct</B> switch causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Additionally, it makes the code suboptimal.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
<DT><B>-finstrument-functions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCGD"></A>
Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions will be called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
<TT>&quot;__builtin_return_address&quot;</TT> does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)


<P>




<PRE>
        void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
                                       void *call_site);
        void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
                                       void *call_site);

</PRE>




<P>


The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.


<P>


This currently disables function inlining.  This restriction is
expected to be removed in future releases.


<P>


A function may be given the attribute <TT>&quot;no_instrument_function&quot;</TT>, in
which case this instrumentation will not be done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).
<DT><B>-fstack-check</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCGE"></A>
Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the
stack.  You should specify this flag if you are running in an
environment with multiple threads, but only rarely need to specify it in
a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.


<P>


Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the
operating system must do that.  The switch causes generation of code
to ensure that the operating system sees the stack being extended.
<DT><B>-fstack-limit-register=</B><I>reg</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixCGF"></A>

<DT><B>-fstack-limit-symbol=</B><I>sym</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixCGG"></A>
<DT><B>-fno-stack-limit</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCGH"></A>

Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value,
either the value of a register or the address of a symbol.  If the stack
would grow beyond the value, a signal is raised.  For most targets,
the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.


<P>


For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address <B>0x80000000</B>
and grows downwards, you can use the flags
<B>-fstack-limit-symbol=__stack_limit</B> and
<B>-Wl,--defsym,__stack_limit=0x7ffe0000</B> to enforce a stack limit
of 128KB.  Note that this may only work with the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker.
<DT><B>-fargument-alias</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCGI"></A>

<DT><B>-fargument-noalias</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCGJ"></A>
<DT><B>-fargument-noalias-global</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCGK"></A>

Specify the possible relationships among parameters and between
parameters and global data.


<P>


<B>-fargument-alias</B> specifies that arguments (parameters) may
alias each other and may alias global storage.<B>-fargument-noalias</B> specifies that arguments do not alias
each other, but may alias global storage.<B>-fargument-noalias-global</B> specifies that arguments do not
alias each other and do not alias global storage.


<P>


Each language will automatically use whatever option is required by
the language standard.  You should not need to use these options yourself.
<DT><B>-fleading-underscore</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixCGL"></A>
This option and its counterpart, <B>-fno-leading-underscore</B>, forcibly
change the way C symbols are represented in the object file.  One use
is to help link with legacy assembly code.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> the <B>-fleading-underscore</B> switch causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to
generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
Not all targets provide complete support for this switch.
<DT><B>-ftls-model=</B><I>model</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixCGM"></A>
Alter the thread-local storage model to be used.
The <I>model</I> argument should be one of <TT>&quot;global-dynamic&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;local-dynamic&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;initial-exec&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;local-exec&quot;</TT>.


<P>


The default without <B>-fpic</B> is <TT>&quot;initial-exec&quot;</TT>; with
<B>-fpic</B> the default is <TT>&quot;global-dynamic&quot;</TT>.
