<H2>Options for Debugging Your Program or <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT></H2>

<A NAME="ixAJC"></A>
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC:</FONT>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-g</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJD"></A>
Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, <FONT SIZE="-1">COFF</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">XCOFF</FONT>, or <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT>).  <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT> can work with this debugging
information.


<P>


On most systems that use stabs format, <B>-g</B> enables use of extra
debugging information that only <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT> can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT> but will probably make other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use <B>-gstabs+</B>, <B>-gstabs</B>,
<B>-gxcoff+</B>, <B>-gxcoff</B>, or <B>-gvms</B> (see below).


<P>


Unlike most other C compilers, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> allows you to use <B>-g</B> with
<B>-O</B>.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values were already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they were moved out of loops.


<P>


Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.


<P>


The following options are useful when <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.
<DT><B>-ggdb</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJE"></A>
Produce debugging information for use by <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT>.  This means to use the
most expressive format available (<FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> 2, stabs, or the native format
if neither of those are supported), including <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT> extensions if at all
possible.
<DT><B>-gstabs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJF"></A>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT> extensions.  This is the format used by <FONT SIZE="-1">DBX</FONT> on most <FONT SIZE="-1">BSD</FONT>
systems.  On <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS</FONT>, Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option
produces stabs debugging output which is not understood by <FONT SIZE="-1">DBX</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">SDB</FONT>.
On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> assembler.
<DT><B>-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJG"></A>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
for only symbols that are actually used.
<DT><B>-gstabs+</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJH"></A>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
using <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extensions understood only by the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> debugger (<FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT>).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program.
<DT><B>-gcoff</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJI"></A>
Produce debugging information in <FONT SIZE="-1">COFF</FONT> format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by <FONT SIZE="-1">SDB</FONT> on most System V systems prior to
System V Release 4.
<DT><B>-gxcoff</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJJ"></A>
Produce debugging information in <FONT SIZE="-1">XCOFF</FONT> format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by the <FONT SIZE="-1">DBX</FONT> debugger on <FONT SIZE="-1">IBM</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">RS/6000</FONT> systems.
<DT><B>-gxcoff+</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJK"></A>
Produce debugging information in <FONT SIZE="-1">XCOFF</FONT> format (if that is supported),
using <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extensions understood only by the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> debugger (<FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT>).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program, and may cause assemblers other than the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
assembler (<FONT SIZE="-1">GAS</FONT>) to fail with an error.
<DT><B>-gdwarf-2</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJL"></A>
Produce debugging information in <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> version 2 format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by <FONT SIZE="-1">DBX</FONT> on <FONT SIZE="-1">IRIX</FONT> 6.
<DT><B>-gvms</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJM"></A>
Produce debugging information in <FONT SIZE="-1">VMS</FONT> debug format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by <FONT SIZE="-1">DEBUG</FONT> on <FONT SIZE="-1">VMS</FONT> systems.
<DT><B>-g</B><I>level</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJN"></A>

<DT><B>-ggdb</B><I>level</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJO"></A>
<DT><B>-gstabs</B><I>level</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJP"></A>
<DT><B>-gcoff</B><I>level</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJQ"></A>
<DT><B>-gxcoff</B><I>level</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJR"></A>
<DT><B>-gvms</B><I>level</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJS"></A>

Request debugging information and also use <I>level</I> to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.


<P>


Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, but no information
about local variables and no line numbers.


<P>


Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use <B>-g3</B>.


<P>


Note that in order to avoid confusion between <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF1</FONT> debug level 2,
and <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF2</FONT> <B>-gdwarf-2</B> does not accept a concatenated debug
level.  Instead use an additional <B>-g</B><I>level</I> option to
change the debug level for <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF2</FONT>.
<DT><B>-feliminate-dwarf2-dups</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJT"></A>
Compress <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF2</FONT> debugging information by eliminating duplicated
information about each symbol.  This option only makes sense when
generating <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF2</FONT> debugging information with <B>-gdwarf-2</B>.
<DT><B>-p</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJU"></A>
Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <B>prof</B>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.
<DT><B>-pg</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJV"></A>
Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <B>gprof</B>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.
<DT><B>-Q</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJW"></A>
Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled, and
print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.
<DT><B>-ftime-report</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJX"></A>
Makes the compiler print some statistics about the time consumed by each
pass when it finishes.
<DT><B>-fmem-report</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJY"></A>
Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation when it finishes.
<DT><B>-fprofile-arcs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAJZ"></A>
Add code so that program flow <I>arcs</I> are instrumented.  During
execution the program records how many times each branch and call is
executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  When the compiled
program exits it saves this data to a file called
<I>auxname.gcda</I> for each source file. The data may be used for
profile-directed optimizations (<B>-fbranch-probabilities</B>), or for
test coverage analysis (<B>-ftest-coverage</B>). Each object file's
<I>auxname</I> is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file. In both cases any suffix is removed
(e.g.  <I>foo.gcda</I> for input file <I>dir/foo.c</I>, or
<I>dir/foo.gcda</I> for output file specified as <B>-o dir/foo.o</B>).
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>@bullet<DD>
<A NAME="ixAKA"></A>
Compile the source files with <B>-fprofile-arcs</B> plus optimization
and code generation options. For test coverage analysis, use the
additional <B>-ftest-coverage</B> option. You do not need to profile
every source file in a program.
<DT>@cvmmfu<DD>
<A NAME="ixAKB"></A>
Link your object files with <B>-lgcov</B> or <B>-fprofile-arcs</B>
(the latter implies the former).
<DT>@dwnngv<DD>
<A NAME="ixAKC"></A>
Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile
information. This may be repeated any number of times. You can run
concurrent instances of your program, and provided that the file system
supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated. Also
<TT>&quot;fork&quot;</TT> calls are detected and correctly handled (double counting
will not happen).
<DT>@exoohw<DD>
<A NAME="ixAKD"></A>
For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files again with
the same optimization and code generation options plus
<B>-fbranch-probabilities</B>.
<DT>@fyppix<DD>
<A NAME="ixAKE"></A>
For test coverage analysis, use <B>gcov</B> to produce human readable
information from the <I>.gcno</I> and <I>.gcda</I> files. Refer to the
<B>gcov</B> documentation for further information.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>


<P>


With <B>-fprofile-arcs</B>, for each function of your program <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph.
Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the
compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are
executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic
block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.
</DL>

<DT><B>-ftest-coverage</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKF"></A>
Produce a notes file that the <B>gcov</B> code-coverage utility can use to
show program coverage. Each source file's note file is called
<I>auxname.gcno</I>. Refer to the <B>-fprofile-arcs</B> option
above for a description of <I>auxname</I> and instructions on how to
generate test coverage data. Coverage data will match the source files
more closely, if you do not optimize.
<DT><B>-d</B><I>letters</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAKG"></A>
Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by
<I>letters</I>.  This is used for debugging the compiler.  The file names
for most of the dumps are made by appending a pass number and a word to
the <I>dumpname</I>. <I>dumpname</I> is generated from the name of the
output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an executable,
otherwise it is the basename of the source file. In both cases any
suffix is removed (e.g.  <I>foo.01.rtl</I> or <I>foo.02.sibling</I>).
Here are the possible letters for use in <I>letters</I>, and their
meanings:

</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
</DL>

<DT><B>-fdump-unnumbered</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixALX"></A>
When doing debugging dumps (see <B>-d</B> option above), suppress instruction
numbers and line number note output.  This makes it more feasible to
use diff on debugging dumps for compiler invocations with different
options, in particular with and without <B>-g</B>.
<DT><B>-fdump-translation-unit</B> (C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixALY"></A>

<DT><B>-fdump-translation-unit-</B><I>options</I><B> </B>(C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixALZ"></A>

Dump a representation of the tree structure for the entire translation
unit to a file.  The file name is made by appending <I>.tu</I> to the
source file name.  If the <B>-</B><I>options</I> form is used, <I>options</I>
controls the details of the dump as described for the
<B>-fdump-tree</B> options.
<DT><B>-fdump-class-hierarchy</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAMA"></A>

<DT><B>-fdump-class-hierarchy-</B><I>options</I><B> </B>(C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAMB"></A>

Dump a representation of each class's hierarchy and virtual function
table layout to a file.  The file name is made by appending <I>.class</I>
to the source file name.  If the <B>-</B><I>options</I> form is used,
<I>options</I> controls the details of the dump as described for the
<B>-fdump-tree</B> options.
<DT><B>-fdump-tree-</B><I>switch</I><B> </B>(C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAMC"></A>

<DT><B>-fdump-tree-</B><I>switch</I><B>-</B><I>options</I><B> </B>(C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAMD"></A>

Control the dumping at various stages of processing the intermediate
language tree to a file.  The file name is generated by appending a switch
specific suffix to the source file name.  If the <B>-</B><I>options</I>
form is used, <I>options</I> is a list of <B>-</B> separated options that
control the details of the dump. Not all options are applicable to all
dumps, those which are not meaningful will be ignored. The following
options are available
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>address</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAME"></A>
Print the address of each node.  Usually this is not meaningful as it
changes according to the environment and source file. Its primary use
is for tying up a dump file with a debug environment.
<DT><B>slim</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMF"></A>
Inhibit dumping of members of a scope or body of a function merely
because that scope has been reached. Only dump such items when they
are directly reachable by some other path.
<DT><B>all</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMG"></A>
Turn on all options.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>


<P>


The following tree dumps are possible:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>original</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMH"></A>
Dump before any tree based optimization, to <I>file.original</I>.
<DT><B>optimized</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMI"></A>
Dump after all tree based optimization, to <I>file.optimized</I>.
<DT><B>inlined</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMJ"></A>
Dump after function inlining, to <I>file.inlined</I>.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
</DL>

<DT><B>-frandom-seed=</B><I>string</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMK"></A>
This option provides a seed that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses when it would otherwise use
random numbers.  It is used to generate certain symbol names
that have to be different in every compiled file. It is also used to
place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files that
produce them. You can use the <B>-frandom-seed</B> option to produce
reproducibly identical object files.


<P>


The <I>string</I> should be different for every file you compile.
<DT><B>-fsched-verbose=</B><I>n</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAML"></A>
On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the
amount of debugging output the scheduler prints.  This information is
written to standard error, unless <B>-dS</B> or <B>-dR</B> is
specified, in which case it is output to the usual dump
listing file, <I>.sched</I> or <I>.sched2</I> respectively.  However
for <I>n</I> greater than nine, the output is always printed to standard
error.


<P>


For <I>n</I> greater than zero, <B>-fsched-verbose</B> outputs the
same information as <B>-dRS</B>.  For <I>n</I> greater than one, it
also output basic block probabilities, detailed ready list information
and unit/insn info.  For <I>n</I> greater than two, it includes <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT>
at abort point, control-flow and regions info.  And for <I>n</I> over
four, <B>-fsched-verbose</B> also includes dependence info.
<DT><B>-save-temps</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMM"></A>
Store the usual ``temporary'' intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling <I>foo.c</I> with <B>-c -save-temps</B> would produce files
<I>foo.i</I> and <I>foo.s</I>, as well as <I>foo.o</I>.  This creates a
preprocessed <I>foo.i</I> output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.
<DT><B>-time</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMN"></A>
Report the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler
(plus the linker if linking is done).  The output looks like this:


<P>




<PRE>
        # cc1 0.12 0.01
        # as 0.00 0.01

</PRE>




<P>


The first number on each line is the ``user time,'' that is time spent
executing the program itself.  The second number is ``system time,''
time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program.
Both numbers are in seconds.
<DT><B>-print-file-name=</B><I>library</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMO"></A>
Print the full absolute name of the library file <I>library</I> that
would be used when linking---and don't do anything else.  With this
option, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
file name.
<DT><B>-print-multi-directory</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMP"></A>
Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by any
other switches present in the command line.  This directory is supposed
to exist in <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B>.
<DT><B>-print-multi-lib</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMQ"></A>
Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler switches
that enable them.  The directory name is separated from the switches by
<B>;</B>, and each switch starts with an <B>@} instead of the
</B>@samp<B>{-</B>, without spaces between multiple switches.  This is supposed to
ease shell-processing.
<DT><B>-print-prog-name=</B><I>program</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMR"></A>
Like <B>-print-file-name</B>, but searches for a program such as <B>cpp</B>.
<DT><B>-print-libgcc-file-name</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMS"></A>
Same as <B>-print-file-name=libgcc.a</B>.


<P>


This is useful when you use <B>-nostdlib</B> or <B>-nodefaultlibs</B>
but you do want to link with <I>libgcc.a</I>.  You can do

<DT><B>-print-search-dirs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMT"></A>
Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list of
program and library directories <B>gcc</B> will search---and don't do anything else.


<P>


This is useful when <B>gcc</B> prints the error message
<B>installation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory</B>.
To resolve this you either need to put <I>cpp0</I> and the other compiler
components where <B>gcc</B> expects to find them, or you can set the environment
variable <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B> to the directory where you installed them.
Don't forget the trailing '/'.
<DT><B>-dumpmachine</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMU"></A>
Print the compiler's target machine (for example,
<B>i686-pc-linux-gnu</B>)---and don't do anything else.
<DT><B>-dumpversion</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMV"></A>
Print the compiler version (for example, <B>3.0</B>)---and don't do
anything else.
<DT><B>-dumpspecs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMW"></A>
Print the compiler's built-in specs---and don't do anything else.  (This
is used when <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> itself is being built.)  
<DT><B>-feliminate-unused-debug-types</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMX"></A>
Normally, when producing <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF2</FONT> output, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will emit debugging
information for all types declared in a compilation
unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit.  Sometimes this is useful, such as
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is
not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.
With this option, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will avoid producing debug symbol output
for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.
