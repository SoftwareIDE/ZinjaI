<H2>Compiling C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> Programs</H2>

<A NAME="ixACL"></A>
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> source files conventionally use one of the suffixes <B>.C</B>,
<B>.cc</B>, <B>.cpp</B>, <B>.CPP</B>, <B>.c++</B>, <B>.cp</B>, or
<B>.cxx</B>; C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> header files often use <B>.hh</B> or <B>.H</B>; and
preprocessed C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> files use the suffix <B>.ii</B>.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs even if you
call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually
with the name <B>gcc</B>).
<P>

However, C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs often require class libraries as well as a
compiler that understands the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> language---and under some
circumstances, you might want to compile programs or header files from
standard input, or otherwise without a suffix that flags them as C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
programs.  You might also like to precompile a C header file with a
<B>.h</B> extension to be used in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> compilations.  <B>g++</B> is a
program that calls <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> with the default language set to C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, and
automatically specifies linking against the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> library.  On many
systems, <B>g++</B> is also installed with the name <B>c++</B>.
<P>

When you compile C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Options Controlling C Dialect</H2>

<A NAME="ixACM"></A>
The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C) that the compiler accepts:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-ansi</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACN"></A>
In C mode, support all <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C90 programs.  In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> mode,
remove <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extensions that conflict with <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.


<P>


This turns off certain features of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> that are incompatible with <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT>
C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> (when compiling C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> code),
such as the <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;typeof&quot;</TT> keywords, and
predefined macros such as <TT>&quot;unix&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;vax&quot;</TT> that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> style <B>//</B> comments as well as
the <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> keyword.


<P>


The alternate keywords <TT>&quot;__asm__&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;__extension__&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;__inline__&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;__typeof__&quot;</TT> continue to work despite
<B>-ansi</B>.  You would not want to use them in an <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with <B>-ansi</B>.  Alternate predefined macros
such as <TT>&quot;__unix__&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;__vax__&quot;</TT> are also available, with or
without <B>-ansi</B>.


<P>


The <B>-ansi</B> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, <B>-pedantic</B> is required in
addition to <B>-ansi</B>.  


<P>


The macro <TT>&quot;__STRICT_ANSI__&quot;</TT> is predefined when the <B>-ansi</B>
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.


<P>


Functions which would normally be built in but do not have semantics
defined by <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C (such as <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;ffs&quot;</TT>) are not built-in
functions with <B>-ansi</B> is used.  
<DT><B>-std=</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACO"></A>
Determine the language standard.  This option is currently only
supported when compiling C or C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.  A value for this option must be
provided; possible values are
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>c89</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACP"></A>

<DT><B>iso9899:1990</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACQ"></A>

<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C90 (same as <B>-ansi</B>).
<DT><B>iso9899:199409</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACR"></A>
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C90 as modified in amendment 1.
<DT><B>c99</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACS"></A>

<DT><B>c9x</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACT"></A>
<DT><B>iso9899:1999</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACU"></A>
<DT><B>iso9899:199x</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACV"></A>

<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C99.  Note that this standard is not yet fully supported; see
&lt;<B><A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.4/c99status.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.4/c99status.html</A></B>&gt; for more information.  The
names <B>c9x</B> and <B>iso9899:199x</B> are deprecated.
<DT><B>gnu89</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACW"></A>
Default, <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C90 plus <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extensions (including some C99 features).
<DT><B>gnu99</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACX"></A>

<DT><B>gnu9x</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACY"></A>

<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C99 plus <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extensions.  When <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C99 is fully implemented in <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>,
this will become the default.  The name <B>gnu9x</B> is deprecated.
<DT><B>c++98</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixACZ"></A>
The 1998 <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standard plus amendments.
<DT><B>gnu++98</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADA"></A>
The same as <B>-std=c++98</B> plus <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extensions.  This is the
default for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> code.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>


<P>


Even when this option is not specified, you can still use some of the
features of newer standards in so far as they do not conflict with
previous C standards.  For example, you may use <TT>&quot;__restrict__&quot;</TT> even
when <B>-std=c99</B> is not specified.


<P>


The <B>-std</B> options specifying some version of <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C have the same
effects as <B>-ansi</B>, except that features that were not in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C90
but are in the specified version (for example, <B>//</B> comments and
the <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> keyword in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C99) are not disabled.
</DL>

<DT><B>-aux-info</B> <I>filename</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixADB"></A>
Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all functions
declared and/or defined in a translation unit, including those in header
files.  This option is silently ignored in any language other than C.


<P>


Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin of
each declaration (source file and line), whether the declaration was
implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (<B>I</B>, <B>N</B> for new or
<B>O</B> for old, respectively, in the first character after the line
number and the colon), and whether it came from a declaration or a
definition (<B>C</B> or <B>F</B>, respectively, in the following
character).  In the case of function definitions, a K&amp;R-style list of
arguments followed by their declarations is also provided, inside
comments, after the declaration.
<DT><B>-fno-asm</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADC"></A>
Do not recognize <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;typeof&quot;</TT> as a
keyword, so that code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use
the keywords <TT>&quot;__asm__&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;__inline__&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;__typeof__&quot;</TT>
instead.  <B>-ansi</B> implies <B>-fno-asm</B>.


<P>


In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, this switch only affects the <TT>&quot;typeof&quot;</TT> keyword, since
<TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> are standard keywords.  You may want to
use the <B>-fno-gnu-keywords</B> flag instead, which has the same
effect.  In C99 mode (<B>-std=c99</B> or <B>-std=gnu99</B>), this
switch only affects the <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;typeof&quot;</TT> keywords, since
<TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> is a standard keyword in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C99.
<DT><B>-fno-builtin</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADD"></A>

<DT><B>-fno-builtin-</B><I>function</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixADE"></A>

Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
<B>__builtin_</B> as prefix.  


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT> may become single
instructions that adjust the stack directly, and calls to <TT>&quot;memcpy&quot;</TT>
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.


<P>


With the <B>-fno-builtin-</B><I>function</I> option
only the built-in function <I>function</I> is
disabled.  <I>function</I> must not begin with <B>__builtin_</B>.  If a
function is named this is not built-in in this version of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>, this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
<B>-fbuiltin-</B><I>function</I> option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using <B>-fno-builtin</B> or
<B>-ffreestanding</B>, you may define macros such as:


<P>




<PRE>
        #define <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?n+abs">abs</A>(n)          __builtin_abs ((n))
        #define strcpy(d, s)    __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))

</PRE>


<DT><B>-fhosted</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADF"></A>
Assert that compilation takes place in a hosted environment.  This implies
<B>-fbuiltin</B>.  A hosted environment is one in which the
entire standard library is available, and in which <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT> has a return
type of <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT>.  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel.
This is equivalent to <B>-fno-freestanding</B>.
<DT><B>-ffreestanding</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADG"></A>
Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding environment.  This
implies <B>-fno-builtin</B>.  A freestanding environment
is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
not necessarily be at <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT>.  The most obvious example is an <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> kernel.
This is equivalent to <B>-fno-hosted</B>.
<DT><B>-fms-extensions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADH"></A>
Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files.
<DT><B>-trigraphs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADI"></A>
Support <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C trigraphs.  The <B>-ansi</B> option (and <B>-std</B>
options for strict <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> C conformance) implies <B>-trigraphs</B>.
<DT><B>-no-integrated-cpp</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADJ"></A>
Performs a compilation in two passes: preprocessing and compiling.  This
option allows a user supplied ``cc1'', ``cc1plus'', or ``cc1obj'' via the
<B>-B</B> option. The user supplied compilation step can then add in
an additional preprocessing step after normal preprocessing but before
compiling. The default is to use the integrated cpp (internal cpp)


<P>


The semantics of this option will change if ``cc1'', ``cc1plus'', and
``cc1obj'' are merged.
<DT><B>-traditional</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADK"></A>

<DT><B>-traditional-cpp</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADL"></A>

Formerly, these options caused <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to attempt to emulate a pre-standard
C compiler.  They are now only supported with the <B>-E</B> switch.
The preprocessor continues to support a pre-standard mode.  See the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPP</FONT> manual for details.
<DT><B>-fcond-mismatch</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADM"></A>
Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second and
third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.  This option
is not supported for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.
<DT><B>-funsigned-char</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADN"></A>
Let the type <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT> be unsigned, like <TT>&quot;unsigned char&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Each kind of machine has a default for what <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT> should
be.  It is either like <TT>&quot;unsigned char&quot;</TT> by default or like
<TT>&quot;signed char&quot;</TT> by default.


<P>


Ideally, a portable program should always use <TT>&quot;signed char&quot;</TT> or
<TT>&quot;unsigned char&quot;</TT> when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use plain <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT> and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.


<P>


The type <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT> is always a distinct type from each of
<TT>&quot;signed char&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;unsigned char&quot;</TT>, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.
<DT><B>-fsigned-char</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADO"></A>
Let the type <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT> be signed, like <TT>&quot;signed char&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Note that this is equivalent to <B>-fno-unsigned-char</B>, which is
the negative form of <B>-funsigned-char</B>.  Likewise, the option
<B>-fno-signed-char</B> is equivalent to <B>-funsigned-char</B>.
<DT><B>-fsigned-bitfields</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADP"></A>

<DT><B>-funsigned-bitfields</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADQ"></A>
<DT><B>-fno-signed-bitfields</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADR"></A>
<DT><B>-fno-unsigned-bitfields</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADS"></A>

These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either <TT>&quot;signed&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;unsigned&quot;</TT>.  By
default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT> are signed types.
<DT><B>-fwritable-strings</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADT"></A>
Store string constants in the writable data segment and don't uniquize
them.  This is for compatibility with old programs which assume they can
write into string constants.


<P>


Writing into string constants is a very bad idea; ``constants'' should
be constant.


<P>


This option is deprecated.

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Options Controlling C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> Dialect</H2>

<A NAME="ixADU"></A>
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs; but you can also use most of the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file <TT>&quot;firstClass.C&quot;</TT> like this:
<P>



<PRE>
        g++ -g -frepo -O -c firstClass.C

</PRE>


<P>

In this example, only <B>-frepo</B> is an option meant
only for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>.
<P>

Here is a list of options that are <I>only</I> for compiling C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-fabi-version=</B><I>n</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixADV"></A>
Use version <I>n</I> of the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT>.  Version 2 is the version of the
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> that first appeared in G++ 3.4.  Version 1 is the version of
the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> that first appeared in G++ 3.2.  Version 0 will always be
the version that conforms most closely to the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> specification.
Therefore, the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> obtained using version 0 will change as <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> bugs
are fixed.


<P>


The default is version 2.
<DT><B>-fno-access-control</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADW"></A>
Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.
<DT><B>-fcheck-new</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADX"></A>
Check that the pointer returned by <TT>&quot;operator new&quot;</TT> is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standard specifies that
<TT>&quot;operator new&quot;</TT> will only return <TT>0</TT> if it is declared
<B></B>throw()<B></B>, in which case the compiler will always check the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
<TT>&quot;operator new&quot;</TT> has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing <TT>&quot;std::bad_alloc&quot;</TT>.  See also
<B>new (nothrow)</B>.
<DT><B>-fconserve-space</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADY"></A>
Put uninitialized or runtime-initialized global variables into the
common segment, as C does.  This saves space in the executable at the
cost of not diagnosing duplicate definitions.  If you compile with this
flag and your program mysteriously crashes after <TT>&quot;main()&quot;</TT> has
completed, you may have an object that is being destroyed twice because
two definitions were merged.


<P>


This option is no longer useful on most targets, now that support has
been added for putting variables into <FONT SIZE="-1">BSS</FONT> without making them common.
<DT><B>-fno-const-strings</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixADZ"></A>
Give string constants type <TT>&quot;char *&quot;</TT> instead of type <TT>&quot;const
char *&quot;</TT>.  By default, G++ uses type <TT>&quot;const char *&quot;</TT> as required by
the standard.  Even if you use <B>-fno-const-strings</B>, you cannot
actually modify the value of a string constant, unless you also use
<B>-fwritable-strings</B>.


<P>


This option might be removed in a future release of G++.  For maximum
portability, you should structure your code so that it works with
string constants that have type <TT>&quot;const char *&quot;</TT>.
<DT><B>-fno-elide-constructors</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEA"></A>
The C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
which is only used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.
<DT><B>-fno-enforce-eh-specs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEB"></A>
Don't check for violation of exception specifications at runtime.  This
option violates the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standard, but may be useful for reducing code
size in production builds, much like defining <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>NDEBUG</B></FONT><B></B>.  The compiler
will still optimize based on the exception specifications.
<DT><B>-ffor-scope</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEC"></A>

<DT><B>-fno-for-scope</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAED"></A>

If <B>-ffor-scope</B> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <I>for-init-statement</I> is limited to the <B>for</B> loop itself,
as specified by the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standard.
If <B>-fno-for-scope</B> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <I>for-init-statement</I> extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional)
implementations of C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.


<P>


The default if neither flag is given to follow the standard,
but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.
<DT><B>-fno-gnu-keywords</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEE"></A>
Do not recognize <TT>&quot;typeof&quot;</TT> as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword <TT>&quot;__typeof__&quot;</TT> instead.
<B>-ansi</B> implies <B>-fno-gnu-keywords</B>.
<DT><B>-fno-implicit-templates</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEF"></A>
Never emit code for non-inline templates which are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations.
<DT><B>-fno-implicit-inline-templates</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEG"></A>
Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either.
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and
without optimization will need the same set of explicit instantiations.
<DT><B>-fno-implement-inlines</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEH"></A>
To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by <B>#pragma implementation</B>.  This will cause linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.
<DT><B>-fms-extensions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEI"></A>
Disable pedantic warnings about constructs used in <FONT SIZE="-1">MFC</FONT>, such as implicit
int and getting a pointer to member function via non-standard syntax.
<DT><B>-fno-nonansi-builtins</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEJ"></A>
Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by
<FONT SIZE="-1">ANSI/ISO</FONT> C.  These include <TT>&quot;ffs&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;_exit&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;index&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;bzero&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;conjf&quot;</TT>, and other related functions.
<DT><B>-fno-operator-names</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEK"></A>
Do not treat the operator name keywords <TT>&quot;and&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;bitand&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;bitor&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;compl&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;not&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;or&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;xor&quot;</TT> as
synonyms as keywords.
<DT><B>-fno-optional-diags</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEL"></A>
Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to
issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for
a name having multiple meanings within a class.
<DT><B>-fpermissive</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEM"></A>
Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to
warnings.  Thus, using <B>-fpermissive</B> will allow some
nonconforming code to compile.
<DT><B>-frepo</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEN"></A>
Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This option also
implies <B>-fno-implicit-templates</B>.  
<DT><B>-fno-rtti</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEO"></A>
Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> runtime type identification features
(<B>dynamic_cast</B> and <B>typeid</B>).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but it will generate it as
needed.
<DT><B>-fstats</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEP"></A>
Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation.
This information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.
<DT><B>-ftemplate-depth-</B><I>n</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEQ"></A>
Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to <I>n</I>.
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  <FONT SIZE="-1">ANSI/ISO</FONT> C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17.
<DT><B>-fuse-cxa-atexit</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAER"></A>
Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
<TT>&quot;__cxa_atexit&quot;</TT> function rather than the <TT>&quot;atexit&quot;</TT> function.
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but will only work if your C library supports
<TT>&quot;__cxa_atexit&quot;</TT>.
<DT><B>-fno-weak</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAES"></A>
Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker.
By default, G++ will use weak symbols if they are available.  This
option exists only for testing, and should not be used by end-users;
it will result in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option may
be removed in a future release of G++.
<DT><B>-nostdinc++</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAET"></A>
Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option
is used when building the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> library.)

In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-fno-default-inline</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAEU"></A>
Do not assume <B>inline</B> for functions defined inside a class scope.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Note&nbsp;that&nbsp;these
functions will have linkage like inline functions; they just won't be
inlined by default.
<DT><B>-Wabi</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAEV"></A>
Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with the
vendor-neutral C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT>.  Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
will be compatible.


<P>


You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.


<P>


The known incompatibilities at this point include:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for bit-fields.  G++ may attempt to
pack data into the same byte as a base class.  For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct A { virtual void f(); int f1 : 1; };
        struct B : public A { int f2 : 1; };

</PRE>




<P>


In this case, G++ will place <TT>&quot;B::f2&quot;</TT> into the same byte
as<TT>&quot;A::f1&quot;</TT>; other compilers will not.  You can avoid this problem
by explicitly padding <TT>&quot;A&quot;</TT> so that its size is a multiple of the
byte size on your platform; that will cause G++ and other compilers to
layout <TT>&quot;B&quot;</TT> identically.
<DT>*<DD>
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual bases.  G++ does not use
tail padding when laying out virtual bases.  For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; };
        struct B { B(); char c2; };
        struct C : public A, public virtual B {};

</PRE>




<P>


In this case, G++ will not place <TT>&quot;B&quot;</TT> into the tail-padding for
<TT>&quot;A&quot;</TT>; other compilers will.  You can avoid this problem by
explicitly padding <TT>&quot;A&quot;</TT> so that its size is a multiple of its
alignment (ignoring virtual base classes); that will cause G++ and other
compilers to layout <TT>&quot;C&quot;</TT> identically.
<DT>*<DD>
Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater than that
of their underlying types, when the bit-fields appear in a union.  For
example:


<P>




<PRE>
        union U { int i : 4096; };

</PRE>




<P>


Assuming that an <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT> does not have 4096 bits, G++ will make the
union too small by the number of bits in an <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
Empty classes can be placed at incorrect offsets.  For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct A {};

</PRE>




<P>




<PRE>
        struct B {
          A a;
          virtual void f ();
        };

</PRE>




<P>




<PRE>
        struct C : public B, public A {};

</PRE>




<P>


G++ will place the <TT>&quot;A&quot;</TT> base class of <TT>&quot;C&quot;</TT> at a nonzero offset;
it should be placed at offset zero.  G++ mistakenly believes that the
<TT>&quot;A&quot;</TT> data member of <TT>&quot;B&quot;</TT> is already at offset zero.
<DT>*<DD>
Names of template functions whose types involve <TT>&quot;typename&quot;</TT> or
template template parameters can be mangled incorrectly.


<P>




<PRE>
        template &lt;typename Q&gt;
        void f(typename Q::X) {}

</PRE>




<P>




<PRE>
        template &lt;template &lt;typename&gt; class Q&gt;
        void f(typename Q&lt;int&gt;::X) {}

</PRE>




<P>


Instantiations of these templates may be mangled incorrectly.

<DT><B>-Wctor-dtor-privacy</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAEW"></A>
Warn when a class seems unusable because all the constructors or
destructors in that class are private, and it has neither friends nor
public static member functions.
<DT><B>-Wnon-virtual-dtor</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAEX"></A>
Warn when a class appears to be polymorphic, thereby requiring a virtual

This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT><B>-Wreorder</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAEY"></A>
Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does not
match the order in which they must be executed.  For instance:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct A {
          int i;
          int j;
          A(): j (0), i (1) { }
        };

</PRE>




<P>


The compiler will rearrange the member initializers for <B>i</B>
and <B>j</B> to match the declaration order of the members, emitting
a warning to that effect.  This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
</DL>
<P>

The following <B>-W...</B> options are not affected by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-Weffc++</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAEZ"></A>
Warn about violations of the following style guidelines from Scott Meyers'
<I>Effective C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT></I> book:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Item 11:  Define a copy constructor and an assignment operator for classes

<DT>*<DD>
Item 12:  Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors.
<DT>*<DD>
Item 14:  Make destructors virtual in base classes.

<DT>*<DD>
Item 23:  Don't try to return a reference when you must return an object.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>


<P>


Also warn about violations of the following style guidelines from
Scott Meyers' <I>More Effective C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT></I> book:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Item 6:  Distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment and
decrement operators.
<DT>*<DD>
Item 7:  Never overload <TT>&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;||&quot;</TT>, or <TT>&quot;,&quot;</TT>.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>


<P>


When selecting this option, be aware that the standard library
headers do not obey all of these guidelines; use <B>grep -v</B>
to filter out those warnings.
</DL>

<DT><B>-Wno-deprecated</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAFA"></A>
Do not warn about usage of deprecated features.  
<DT><B>-Wno-non-template-friend</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAFB"></A>
Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
within a template.  Since the advent of explicit template specification
support in G++, if the name of the friend is an unqualified-id (i.e.,
<B>friend foo(int)</B>), the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> language specification demands that the
friend declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function.  (Section
14.5.3).  Before G++ implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
function.  Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default
behavior for G++, <B>-Wnon-template-friend</B> allows the compiler to
check existing code for potential trouble spots and is on by default.
This new compiler behavior can be turned off with
<B>-Wno-non-template-friend</B> which keeps the conformant compiler code
but disables the helpful warning.
<DT><B>-Wold-style-cast</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAFC"></A>
Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast to a non-void type is used within
a C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> program.  The new-style casts (<B>static_cast</B>,
<B>reinterpret_cast</B>, and <B>const_cast</B>) are less vulnerable to
unintended effects and much easier to search for.
<DT><B>-Woverloaded-virtual</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAFD"></A>
Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a
base class.  For example, in:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct A {
          virtual void f();
        };

</PRE>




<P>




<PRE>
        struct B: public A {
          void f(int);
        };

</PRE>




<P>


the <TT>&quot;A&quot;</TT> class version of <TT>&quot;f&quot;</TT> is hidden in <TT>&quot;B&quot;</TT>, and code
like:


<P>




<PRE>
        B* b;
        b-&gt;f();

</PRE>




<P>


will fail to compile.
<DT><B>-Wno-pmf-conversions</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAFE"></A>
Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to member function
to a plain pointer.
<DT><B>-Wsign-promo</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>
<A NAME="ixAFF"></A>
Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
enumerated type to a signed type, over a conversion to an unsigned type of
the same size.  Previous versions of G++ would try to preserve
unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.


<P>




<PRE>
        struct A {
          operator int ();
          A&amp; operator = (int);
        };

</PRE>




<P>




<PRE>
        main ()
        {
          A a,b;
          a = b;
        }

</PRE>




<P>


In this example, G++ will synthesize a default <B>A&amp; operator =
(const A&amp;);</B>, while cfront will use the user-defined <B>operator =</B>.

<H2>Options Controlling Objective-C Dialect</H2>

<A NAME="ixAFG"></A>
(<FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE:</FONT> This manual does not describe the Objective-C language itself.  See
&lt;<B><A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html</A></B>&gt; for references.)
<P>

This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for Objective-C programs, but you can also use most of the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> compiler
options regardless of what language your program is in.  For example,
you might compile a file <TT>&quot;some_class.m&quot;</TT> like this:
<P>



<PRE>
        gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m

</PRE>


<P>

In this example, <B>-fgnu-runtime</B> is an option meant only for
Objective-C programs; you can use the other options with any language
supported by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>.
<P>

Here is a list of options that are <I>only</I> for compiling Objective-C
programs:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-fconstant-string-class=</B><I>class-name</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFH"></A>
Use <I>class-name</I> as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax <TT>&quot;@&quot;...&quot;&quot;</TT>.  The default
class name is <TT>&quot;NXConstantString&quot;</TT> if the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> runtime is being used, and
<TT>&quot;NSConstantString&quot;</TT> if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The
<B>-fconstant-cfstrings</B> option, if also present, will override the
<B>-fconstant-string-class</B> setting and cause <TT>&quot;@&quot;...&quot;&quot;</TT> literals
to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.
<DT><B>-fgnu-runtime</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFI"></A>
Generate object code compatible with the standard <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> Objective-C
runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.
<DT><B>-fnext-runtime</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFJ"></A>
Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X.  The macro
<TT>&quot;__NEXT_RUNTIME__&quot;</TT> is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.
<DT><B>-fno-nil-receivers</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFK"></A>
Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (e.g.,
<TT>&quot;[receiver message:arg]&quot;</TT>) in this translation unit ensure that the receiver
is not <TT>&quot;nil&quot;</TT>.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the runtime to be
used.  Currently, this option is only available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime on Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X 10.3 and later.
<DT><B>-fobjc-exceptions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFL"></A>
Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in Objective-C,
similar to what is offered by C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Java.  Currently, this option is only
available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X 10.3 and later.

          @catch (AnObjCClass *exc) {
            ...
              @throw expr;

              @throw expr;
            ...
          }

</PRE>




<P>


The <TT>@throw</TT> statement may appear anywhere in an Objective-C or
Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> program; when used inside of a <TT>@catch</TT> block, the
<TT>@throw</TT> may appear without an argument (as shown above), in which case
the object caught by the <TT>@catch</TT> will be rethrown.


<P>


Note that only (pointers to) Objective-C objects may be thrown and
caught using this scheme.  When an object is thrown, it will be caught
by the nearest <TT>@catch</TT> clause capable of handling objects of that type,
analogously to how <TT>&quot;catch&quot;</TT> blocks work in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Java.  A
<TT>&quot;@catch(id ...)&quot;</TT> clause (as shown above) may also be provided to catch
any and all Objective-C exceptions not caught by previous <TT>@catch</TT>
clauses (if any).


<P>


The <TT>@finally</TT> clause, if present, will be executed upon exit from the
immediately preceding <TT>&quot;@try ... @catch&quot;</TT> section.  This will happen
regardless of whether any exceptions are thrown, caught or rethrown
inside the <TT>&quot;@try ... @catch&quot;</TT> section, analogously to the behavior
of the <TT>&quot;finally&quot;</TT> clause in Java.


<P>


There are several caveats to using the new exception mechanism:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Although currently designed to be binary compatible with <TT>&quot;NS_HANDLER&quot;</TT>-style
idioms provided by the <TT>&quot;NSException&quot;</TT> class, the new
exceptions can only be used on Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X 10.3 (Panther) and later
systems, due to additional functionality needed in the (NeXT) Objective-C
runtime.
<DT>*<DD>
As mentioned above, the new exceptions do not support handling
types other than Objective-C objects.   Furthermore, when used from
Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, the Objective-C exception model does not interoperate with C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
exceptions at this time.  This means you cannot <TT>@throw</TT> an exception
from Objective-C and <TT>&quot;catch&quot;</TT> it in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, or vice versa
(i.e., <TT>&quot;throw ... @catch&quot;</TT>).
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>


<P>


The <B>-fobjc-exceptions</B> switch also enables the use of synchronization
blocks for thread-safe execution:


<P>




<PRE>
          @synchronized (ObjCClass *guard) {
            ...
          }

</PRE>




<P>


Upon entering the <TT>@synchronized</TT> block, a thread of execution shall
first check whether a lock has been placed on the corresponding <TT>&quot;guard&quot;</TT>
object by another thread.  If it has, the current thread shall wait until
the other thread relinquishes its lock.  Once <TT>&quot;guard&quot;</TT> becomes available,
the current thread will place its own lock on it, execute the code contained in
the <TT>@synchronized</TT> block, and finally relinquish the lock (thereby
making <TT>&quot;guard&quot;</TT> available to other threads).


<P>


Unlike Java, Objective-C does not allow for entire methods to be marked
<TT>@synchronized</TT>.  Note that throwing exceptions out of
<TT>@synchronized</TT> blocks is allowed, and will cause the guarding object
to be unlocked properly.
</DL>

<DT><B>-freplace-objc-classes</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFM"></A>
Emit a special marker instructing <B></B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+ld">ld</A><B>(1)</B> not to statically link in
the resulting object file, and allow <B></B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+dyld">dyld</A><B>(1)</B> to load it in at
run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the Fix-and-Continue
debugging mode, where the object file in question may be recompiled and
dynamically reloaded in the course of program execution, without the need
to restart the program itself.  Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality
is only available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X 10.3
and later.
<DT><B>-fzero-link</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFN"></A>
When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls
to <TT>&quot;objc_getClass(&quot;...&quot;)&quot;</TT> (when the name of the class is known at
compile time) with static class references that get initialized at load time,
which improves run-time performance.  Specifying the <B>-fzero-link</B> flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to <TT>&quot;objc_getClass(&quot;...&quot;)&quot;</TT>
to be retained.  This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during program execution.
<DT><B>-gen-decls</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFO"></A>
Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the source file to a
file named <I>sourcename.decl</I>.
<DT><B>-Wno-protocol</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFP"></A>
If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the <TT>&quot;-Wno-protocol&quot;</TT> option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,
and no warning is issued for them.
<DT><B>-Wselector</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFQ"></A>
Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are
found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list of methods
in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed
for each selector appearing in a <TT>&quot;@selector(...)&quot;</TT>
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has been found
during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final
stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is
found during compilation, or because the <TT>&quot;-fsyntax-only&quot;</TT> option is
being used.
<DT><B>-Wundeclared-selector</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFR"></A>
Warn if a <TT>&quot;@selector(...)&quot;</TT> expression referring to an
undeclared selector is found.  A selector is considered undeclared if no
method with that name has been declared before the
<TT>&quot;@selector(...)&quot;</TT> expression, either explicitly in an
<TT>@interface</TT> or <TT>@protocol</TT> declaration, or implicitly in
an <TT>@implementation</TT> section.  This option always performs its
checks as soon as a <TT>&quot;@selector(...)&quot;</TT> expression is found,
while <TT>&quot;-Wselector&quot;</TT> only performs its checks in the final stage of
compilation.  This also enforces the coding style convention
that methods and selectors must be declared before being used.
<DT><B>-print-objc-runtime-info</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAFS"></A>
Generate C header describing the largest structure that is passed by
