<H2>Options That Control Optimization</H2>

<A NAME="ixAMY"></A>
These options control various sorts of optimizations.
<P>

Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you would expect from the source
code.
<P>

Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.
<P>

The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of
the program.  Using the <B>-funit-at-a-time</B> flag will allow the
compiler to consider information gained from later functions in the
file when compiling a function.  Compiling multiple files at once to a
single output file (and using <B>-funit-at-a-time</B>) will allow
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when
compiling each of them.
<P>

Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-O</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAMZ"></A>

<DT><B>-O1</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANA"></A>

Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.


<P>


With <B>-O</B>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.


<P>


<B>-O</B> turns on the following optimization flags:
<B>-fdefer-pop 
-fmerge-constants 
-fthread-jumps 
-floop-optimize 
-fif-conversion 
-fif-conversion2 
-fdelayed-branch 
-fguess-branch-probability 
-fcprop-registers</B>


<P>


<B>-O</B> also turns on <B>-fomit-frame-pointer</B> on machines
where doing so does not interfere with debugging.
<DT><B>-O2</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANB"></A>
Optimize even more.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  The compiler does not
perform loop unrolling or function inlining when you specify <B>-O2</B>.
As compared to <B>-O</B>, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.


<P>


<B>-O2</B> turns on all optimization flags specified by <B>-O</B>.  It
also turns on the following optimization flags:
<B>-fforce-mem 
-foptimize-sibling-calls 
-fstrength-reduce 
-fcse-follow-jumps  -fcse-skip-blocks 
-frerun-cse-after-loop  -frerun-loop-opt 
-fgcse  -fgcse-lm  -fgcse-sm  -fgcse-las 
-fdelete-null-pointer-checks 
-fexpensive-optimizations 
-fregmove 
-fschedule-insns  -fschedule-insns2 
-fsched-interblock  -fsched-spec 
-fcaller-saves 
-fpeephole2 
-freorder-blocks  -freorder-functions 
-fstrict-aliasing 
-funit-at-a-time 
-falign-functions  -falign-jumps 
-falign-loops  -falign-labels 
-fcrossjumping</B>


<P>


Please note the warning under <B>-fgcse</B> about
invoking <B>-O2</B> on programs that use computed gotos.
<DT><B>-O3</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANC"></A>
Optimize yet more.  <B>-O3</B> turns on all optimizations specified by
<B>-O2</B> and also turns on the <B>-finline-functions</B>,
<B>-fweb</B>, <B>-frename-registers</B> and <B>-funswitch-loops</B>
options.
<DT><B>-O0</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAND"></A>
Do not optimize.  This is the default.
<DT><B>-Os</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANE"></A>
Optimize for size.  <B>-Os</B> enables all <B>-O2</B> optimizations that
do not typically increase code size.  It also performs further
optimizations designed to reduce code size.


<P>


<B>-Os</B> disables the following optimization flags:
<B>-falign-functions  -falign-jumps  -falign-loops 
-falign-labels  -freorder-blocks  -fprefetch-loop-arrays</B>


<P>


If you use multiple <B>-O</B> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.
</DL>
<P>

Options of the form <B>-f</B><I>flag</I> specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of <B>-ffoo</B> would be <B>-fno-foo</B>.  In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed---the one you typically will
use.  You can figure out the other form by either removing <B>no-</B>
or adding it.
<P>

The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by <B>-O</B> options or are related to ones that are.  You
can use the following flags in the rare cases when ``fine-tuning'' of
optimizations to be performed is desired.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-fno-default-inline</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANF"></A>
Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they are
defined inside the class scope (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only).  Otherwise, when you specify
<B>-O</B>, member functions defined inside class scope are compiled
inline by default; i.e., you don't need to add <B>inline</B> in front of
the member function name.
<DT><B>-fno-defer-pop</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANG"></A>
Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function
returns.  For machines which must pop arguments after a function call,
the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pops them all at once.


<P>


Disabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fforce-mem</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANH"></A>
Force memory operands to be copied into registers before doing
arithmetic on them.  This produces better code by making all memory
references potential common subexpressions.  When they are not common
subexpressions, instruction combination should eliminate the separate
register-load.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fforce-addr</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANI"></A>
Force memory address constants to be copied into registers before
doing arithmetic on them.  This may produce better code just as
<B>-fforce-mem</B> may.
<DT><B>-fomit-frame-pointer</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANJ"></A>
Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  <B>It also makes debugging impossible on
some machines.</B>


<P>


On some machines, such as the <FONT SIZE="-1">VAX</FONT>, this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
machine-description macro <TT>&quot;FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED&quot;</TT> controls
whether a target machine supports this flag.  


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-foptimize-sibling-calls</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANK"></A>
Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fno-inline</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANL"></A>
Don't pay attention to the <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> keyword.  Normally this option
is used to keep the compiler from expanding any functions inline.
Note that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be expanded inline.
<DT><B>-finline-functions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANM"></A>
Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
integrating in this way.


<P>


If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
declared <TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT>, then the function is normally not output as
assembler code in its own right.


<P>


Enabled at level <B>-O3</B>.
<DT><B>-finline-limit=</B><I>n</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixANN"></A>
By default, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows the control of this limit for functions that are explicitly marked as
inline (i.e., marked with the inline keyword or defined within the class
definition in c++).  <I>n</I> is the size of functions that can be inlined in
number of pseudo instructions (not counting parameter handling).  The default
value of <I>n</I> is 600.
Increasing this value can result in more inlined code at
the cost of compilation time and memory consumption.  Decreasing usually makes
the compilation faster and less code will be inlined (which presumably
means slower programs).  This option is particularly useful for programs that
use inlining heavily such as those based on recursive templates with C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.


<P>


Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be
specified individually by using <B>--param</B> <I>name</I><B>=</B><I>value</I>.
The <B>-finline-limit=</B><I>n</I> option sets some of these parameters
as follows:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>


<P>




<PRE>
 @item max-inline-insns-single
  is set to I&lt;n&gt;/2.
 @item max-inline-insns-auto
  is set to I&lt;n&gt;/2.
 @item min-inline-insns
  is set to 130 or I&lt;n&gt;/4, whichever is smaller.
 @item max-inline-insns-rtl
  is set to I&lt;n&gt;.

</PRE>


</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>


<P>


See below for a documentation of the individual
parameters controlling inlining.


<P>


<I>Note:</I> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an
abstract measurement of function's size.  In no way, it represents a count
of assembly instructions and as such its exact meaning might change from one
release to an another.
</DL>

<DT><B>-fkeep-inline-functions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANO"></A>
Even if all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function
is declared <TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT>, nevertheless output a separate run-time
callable version of the function.  This switch does not affect
<TT>&quot;extern inline&quot;</TT> functions.
<DT><B>-fkeep-static-consts</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANP"></A>
Emit variables declared <TT>&quot;static const&quot;</TT> when optimization isn't turned
on, even if the variables aren't referenced.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to
check if the variable was referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the <B>-fno-keep-static-consts</B> option.
<DT><B>-fmerge-constants</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANQ"></A>
Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and floating point
constants) across compilation units.


<P>


This option is the default for optimized compilation if the assembler and
linker support it.  Use <B>-fno-merge-constants</B> to inhibit this
behavior.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fmerge-all-constants</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANR"></A>
Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.


<P>


This option implies <B>-fmerge-constants</B>.  In addition to
<B>-fmerge-constants</B> this considers e.g. even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating point
types.  Languages like C or C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> require each non-automatic variable to
have distinct location, so using this option will result in non-conforming
behavior.
<DT><B>-fnew-ra</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANS"></A>
Use a graph coloring register allocator.  Currently this option is meant
only for testing.  Users should not specify this option, since it is not
yet ready for production use.
<DT><B>-fno-branch-count-reg</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANT"></A>
Do not use ``decrement and branch'' instructions on a count register,
but instead generate a sequence of instructions that decrement a
register, compare it against zero, then branch based upon the result.
This option is only meaningful on architectures that support such
instructions, which include x86, PowerPC, <FONT SIZE="-1">IA-64</FONT> and S/390.


<P>


The default is <B>-fbranch-count-reg</B>, enabled when
<B>-fstrength-reduce</B> is enabled.
<DT><B>-fno-function-cse</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANU"></A>
Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
calls a constant function contain the function's address explicitly.


<P>


This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
that alter the assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
performed when this option is not used.


<P>


The default is <B>-ffunction-cse</B>
<DT><B>-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANV"></A>
If the target supports a <FONT SIZE="-1">BSS</FONT> section, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> by default puts variables that
are initialized to zero into <FONT SIZE="-1">BSS</FONT>.  This can save space in the resulting
code.


<P>


This option turns off this behavior because some programs explicitly
rely on variables going to the data section.  E.g., so that the
resulting executable can find the beginning of that section and/or make
assumptions based on that.


<P>


The default is <B>-fzero-initialized-in-bss</B>.
<DT><B>-fstrength-reduce</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANW"></A>
Perform the optimizations of loop strength reduction and
elimination of iteration variables.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fthread-jumps</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANX"></A>
Perform optimizations where we check to see if a jump branches to a
location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.  If
so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of the
second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on whether
the condition is known to be true or false.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fcse-follow-jumps</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANY"></A>
In common subexpression elimination, scan through jump instructions
when the target of the jump is not reached by any other path.  For
example, when <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT> encounters an <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT> statement with an
<TT>&quot;else&quot;</TT> clause, <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT> will follow the jump when the condition
tested is false.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fcse-skip-blocks</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixANZ"></A>
This is similar to <B>-fcse-follow-jumps</B>, but causes <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT> to
follow jumps which conditionally skip over blocks.  When <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT>
encounters a simple <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT> statement with no else clause,
<B>-fcse-skip-blocks</B> causes <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT> to follow the jump around the
body of the <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-frerun-cse-after-loop</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOA"></A>
Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop optimizations has been
performed.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-frerun-loop-opt</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOB"></A>
Run the loop optimizer twice.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fgcse</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOC"></A>
Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass.
This pass also performs global constant and copy propagation.


<P>


<I>Note:</I> When compiling a program using computed gotos, a <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
extension, you may get better runtime performance if you disable
the global common subexpression elimination pass by adding
<B>-fno-gcse</B> to the command line.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fgcse-lm</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOD"></A>
When <B>-fgcse-lm</B> is enabled, global common subexpression elimination will
attempt to move loads which are only killed by stores into themselves.  This
allows a loop containing a load/store sequence to be changed to a load outside
the loop, and a copy/store within the loop.


<P>


Enabled by default when gcse is enabled.
<DT><B>-fgcse-sm</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOE"></A>
When <B>-fgcse-sm</B> is enabled, a store motion pass is run after
global common subexpression elimination.  This pass will attempt to move
stores out of loops.  When used in conjunction with <B>-fgcse-lm</B>,
loops containing a load/store sequence can be changed to a load before
the loop and a store after the loop.


<P>


Enabled by default when gcse is enabled.
<DT><B>-fgcse-las</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOF"></A>
When <B>-fgcse-las</B> is enabled, the global common subexpression
elimination pass eliminates redundant loads that come after stores to the
same memory location (both partial and full redundancies).


<P>


Enabled by default when gcse is enabled.
<DT><B>-floop-optimize</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOG"></A>
Perform loop optimizations: move constant expressions out of loops, simplify
exit test conditions and optionally do strength-reduction and loop unrolling as
well.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fcrossjumping</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOH"></A>
Perform cross-jumping transformation. This transformation unifies equivalent code and save code size. The
resulting code may or may not perform better than without cross-jumping.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fif-conversion</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOI"></A>
Attempt to transform conditional jumps into branch-less equivalents.  This
include use of conditional moves, min, max, set flags and abs instructions, and
some tricks doable by standard arithmetics.  The use of conditional execution
on chips where it is available is controlled by <TT>&quot;if-conversion2&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fif-conversion2</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOJ"></A>
Use conditional execution (where available) to transform conditional jumps into
branch-less equivalents.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOK"></A>
Use global dataflow analysis to identify and eliminate useless checks
for null pointers.  The compiler assumes that dereferencing a null
pointer would have halted the program.  If a pointer is checked after
it has already been dereferenced, it cannot be null.


<P>


In some environments, this assumption is not true, and programs can
safely dereference null pointers.  Use
<B>-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks</B> to disable this optimization
for programs which depend on that behavior.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fexpensive-optimizations</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOL"></A>
Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively expensive.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-foptimize-register-move</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOM"></A>

<DT><B>-fregmove</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAON"></A>

Attempt to reassign register numbers in move instructions and as
operands of other simple instructions in order to maximize the amount of
register tying.  This is especially helpful on machines with two-operand
instructions.


<P>


Note <B>-fregmove</B> and <B>-foptimize-register-move</B> are the same
optimization.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fdelayed-branch</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOO"></A>
If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions
to exploit instruction slots available after delayed branch
instructions.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fschedule-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOP"></A>
If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions to
eliminate execution stalls due to required data being unavailable.  This
helps machines that have slow floating point or memory load instructions
by allowing other instructions to be issued until the result of the load
or floating point instruction is required.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fschedule-insns2</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOQ"></A>
Similar to <B>-fschedule-insns</B>, but requests an additional pass of
instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.  This is
especially useful on machines with a relatively small number of
registers and where memory load instructions take more than one cycle.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fno-sched-interblock</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOR"></A>
Don't schedule instructions across basic blocks.  This is normally
enabled by default when scheduling before register allocation, i.e.
with <B>-fschedule-insns</B> or at <B>-O2</B> or higher.
<DT><B>-fno-sched-spec</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOS"></A>
Don't allow speculative motion of non-load instructions.  This is normally
enabled by default when scheduling before register allocation, i.e.
with <B>-fschedule-insns</B> or at <B>-O2</B> or higher.
<DT><B>-fsched-spec-load</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOT"></A>
Allow speculative motion of some load instructions.  This only makes
sense when scheduling before register allocation, i.e. with
<B>-fschedule-insns</B> or at <B>-O2</B> or higher.
<DT><B>-fsched-spec-load-dangerous</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOU"></A>
Allow speculative motion of more load instructions.  This only makes
sense when scheduling before register allocation, i.e. with
<B>-fschedule-insns</B> or at <B>-O2</B> or higher.
<DT><B>-fsched-stalled-insns=</B><I>n</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOV"></A>
Define how many insns (if any) can be moved prematurely from the queue
of stalled insns into the ready list, during the second scheduling pass.
<DT><B>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=</B><I>n</I><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOW"></A>
Define how many insn groups (cycles) will be examined for a dependency
on a stalled insn that is candidate for premature removal from the queue
of stalled insns.  Has an effect only during the second scheduling pass,
and only if <B>-fsched-stalled-insns</B> is used and its value is not zero.
<DT><B>-fsched2-use-superblocks</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOX"></A>
When scheduling after register allocation, do use superblock scheduling
algorithm.  Superblock scheduling allows motion across basic block boundaries
resulting on faster schedules.  This option is experimental, as not all machine
descriptions used by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> model the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> closely enough to avoid unreliable
results from the algorithm.


<P>


This only makes sense when scheduling after register allocation, i.e. with
<B>-fschedule-insns2</B> or at <B>-O2</B> or higher.
<DT><B>-fsched2-use-traces</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOY"></A>
Use <B>-fsched2-use-superblocks</B> algorithm when scheduling after register
allocation and additionally perform code duplication in order to increase the
size of superblocks using tracer pass.  See <B>-ftracer</B> for details on
trace formation.


<P>


This mode should produce faster but significantly longer programs.  Also
without <TT>&quot;-fbranch-probabilities&quot;</TT> the traces constructed may not match the
reality and hurt the performance.  This only makes
sense when scheduling after register allocation, i.e. with
<B>-fschedule-insns2</B> or at <B>-O2</B> or higher.
<DT><B>-fcaller-saves</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAOZ"></A>
Enable values to be allocated in registers that will be clobbered by
function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and restore the
registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done only when it
seems to result in better code than would otherwise be produced.


<P>


This option is always enabled by default on certain machines, usually
those which have no call-preserved registers to use instead.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fmove-all-movables</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAPA"></A>
Forces all invariant computations in loops to be moved
outside the loop.
<DT><B>-freduce-all-givs</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAPB"></A>
Forces all general-induction variables in loops to be
strength-reduced.


<P>


<I>Note:</I> When compiling programs written in Fortran,
<B>-fmove-all-movables</B> and <B>-freduce-all-givs</B> are enabled
by default when you use the optimizer.


<P>


These options may generate better or worse code; results are highly
dependent on the structure of loops within the source code.


<P>


These two options are intended to be removed someday, once
they have helped determine the efficacy of various
approaches to improving loop optimizations.


<P>


Please contact &lt;<B><A HREF="mailto:gcc@gcc.gnu.org">gcc@gcc.gnu.org</A></B>&gt;, and describe how use of
these options affects the performance of your production code.
Examples of code that runs <I>slower</I> when these options are
<I>enabled</I> are very valuable.
<DT><B>-fno-peephole</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAPC"></A>

<DT><B>-fno-peephole2</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAPD"></A>

Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.  The difference
between <B>-fno-peephole</B> and <B>-fno-peephole2</B> is in how they
are implemented in the compiler; some targets use one, some use the
other, a few use both.


<P>


<B>-fpeephole</B> is enabled by default.
<B>-fpeephole2</B> enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fno-guess-branch-probability</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAPE"></A>
Do not guess branch probabilities using a randomized model.


<P>


Sometimes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> will opt to use a randomized model to guess branch
probabilities, when none are available from either profiling feedback
(<B>-fprofile-arcs</B>) or <B>__builtin_expect</B>.  This means that
different runs of the compiler on the same program may produce different
object code.


<P>


In a hard real-time system, people don't want different runs of the
compiler to produce code that has different behavior; minimizing
non-determinism is of paramount import.  This switch allows users to
reduce non-determinism, possibly at the expense of inferior
optimization.


<P>


The default is <B>-fguess-branch-probability</B> at levels
<B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-freorder-blocks</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAPF"></A>
Reorder basic blocks in the compiled function in order to reduce number of
taken branches and improve code locality.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>.
<DT><B>-freorder-functions</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAPG"></A>
Reorder basic blocks in the compiled function in order to reduce number of
taken branches and improve code locality. This is implemented by using special
subsections <TT>&quot;.text.hot&quot;</TT> for most frequently executed functions and
<TT>&quot;.text.unlikely&quot;</TT> for unlikely executed functions.  Reordering is done by
the linker so object file format must support named sections and linker must
place them in a reasonable way.


<P>


Also profile feedback must be available in to make this option effective.  See
<B>-fprofile-arcs</B> for details.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT><B>-fstrict-aliasing</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAPH"></A>
Allows the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an <TT>&quot;unsigned int&quot;</TT> can alias an <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT>, but not a
<TT>&quot;void*&quot;</TT> or a <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT>.  A character type may alias any other
type.


<P>


Pay special attention to code like this:


<P>




<PRE>
        union a_union {
          int i;
          double d;
        };

</PRE>




<P>




<PRE>
        int f() {
          a_union t;
          t.d = 3.0;
          return t.i;
        }

</PRE>




<P>


The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called ``type-punning'') is common.  Even with
<B>-fstrict-aliasing</B>, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above will work as
expected.  However, this code might not:


<P>




<PRE>
        int f() {
          a_union t;
          int* ip;
          t.d = 3.0;
          ip = &amp;t.i;
          return *ip;
        }

</PRE>




<P>


Every language that wishes to perform language-specific alias analysis
should define a function that computes, given an <TT>&quot;tree&quot;</TT>
node, an alias set for the node.  Nodes in different alias sets are not
allowed to alias.  For an example, see the C front-end function
<TT>&quot;c_get_alias_set&quot;</TT>.

Align the start of functions to the next power-of-two greater than

<B>-falign-functions=32</B> aligns functions to the next 32-byte

32-byte boundary only if this can be done by skipping 23 bytes or less.


<P>


<B>-fno-align-functions</B> and <B>-falign-functions=1</B> are

make code slower, because it must insert dummy operations for when the
branch target is reached in the usual flow of the code.

<P>


This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT> is supposed to have.  Similarly for the

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-fbranch-probabilities</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAQE"></A>
After running a program compiled with <B>-fprofile-arcs</B>, you can compile it a second time using
<B>-fbranch-probabilities</B>, to improve optimizations based on
the number of times each branch was taken.  When the program
compiled with <B>-fprofile-arcs</B> exits it saves arc execution
counts to a file called <I>sourcename.gcda</I> for each source
file  The information in this data file is very dependent on the
structure of the generated code, so you must use the same source code
and the same optimization options for both compilations.


<P>


With <B>-fbranch-probabilities</B>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> puts a

These can be used to improve optimization.  Currently, they are only
used in one place: in <I>reorg.c</I>, instead of guessing which path a
branch is mostly to take, the <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>REG_BR_PROB</B></FONT><B></B> values are used to
exactly determine which path is taken more often.
<DT><B>-fprofile-values</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAQF"></A>
If combined with <B>-fprofile-arcs</B>, it adds code so that some
data about values of expressions in the program is gathered.

<DT><B>-fvpt</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAQG"></A>
If combined with <B>-fprofile-arcs</B>, it instructs the compiler to add

better job.
<DT><B>-funit-at-a-time</B><DD>

Parse the whole compilation unit before starting to produce code.
This allows some extra optimizations to take place but consumes more
memory.
<DT><B>-funroll-loops</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAQK"></A>
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or
upon entry to the loop.  <B>-funroll-loops</B> implies
<B>-frerun-cse-after-loop</B>.  It also turns on complete loop peeling
(i.e. complete removal of loops with small constant number of iterations).
This option makes code larger, and may or may not make it run faster.
<DT><B>-funroll-all-loops</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAQL"></A>
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly.
<B>-funroll-all-loops</B> implies the same options as
<B>-funroll-loops</B>.
<DT><B>-fpeel-loops</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAQM"></A>
Peels the loops for that there is enough information that they do not

<DT><B>-fold-unroll-loops</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAQO"></A>
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile
time or upon entry to the loop, using the old loop unroller whose loop
recognition is based on notes from frontend.  <B>-fold-unroll-loops</B> implies
both <B>-fstrength-reduce</B> and <B>-frerun-cse-after-loop</B>.  This

<DT><B>-fold-unroll-all-loops</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAQP"></A>
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered. This is done using the old loop unroller whose loop

<A NAME="ixAQU"></A>

Place each function or data item into its own section in the output

linkers with such optimizations.  <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> may have these optimizations in
the future.


<P>


Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing
so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and linker will

<DT><B>-fbranch-target-load-optimize</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAQV"></A>
Perform branch target register load optimization before prologue / epilogue

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>max-crossjump-edges</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAQY"></A>
The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for crossjumping.
The algorithm used by <B>-fcrossjumping</B> is O(N^2) in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.
<DT><B>max-delay-slot-insn-search</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAQZ"></A>
The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions is searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
will be minimal so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with probably
small improvement in executable run time.
<DT><B>max-delay-slot-live-search</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARA"></A>
When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to
consider when searching for a block with valid live register
information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compile time.  This parameter
should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.
<DT><B>max-gcse-memory</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARB"></A>
The approximate maximum amount of memory that will be allocated in

<DT><B>max-pending-list-length</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARD"></A>
The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling will allow

<DT><B>max-inline-insns-single</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARE"></A>
Several parameters control the tree inliner used in gcc.
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s

<A NAME="ixARF"></A>
When you use <B>-finline-functions</B> (included in <B>-O3</B>),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining

be applied.
The default value is 100.
<DT><B>large-function-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARG"></A>
The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions greater than this
limit inlining is constrained by <B>--param large-function-growth</B>.
This parameter is useful primarily to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear

This parameter is ignored when <B>-funit-at-a-time</B> is not used.
The default value is 3000.
<DT><B>large-function-growth</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARH"></A>

<DT><B>max-inline-insns-rtl</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARJ"></A>
For languages that use the <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT> inliner (this happens at a later stage
than tree inlining), you can set the maximum allowable size (counted
in <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT> instructions) for the <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT> inliner with this parameter.
The default value is 600.
<DT><B>max-unrolled-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARK"></A>
The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if that loop
is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled, it determines how many times
the loop code is unrolled.
<DT><B>max-average-unrolled-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARL"></A>
The maximum number of instructions biased by probabilities of their execution
that a loop should have if that loop is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled,
it determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.
<DT><B>max-unroll-times</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARM"></A>
The maximum number of unrollings of a single loop.
<DT><B>max-peeled-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARN"></A>
The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if that loop
is peeled, and if the loop is peeled, it determines how many times
the loop code is peeled.
<DT><B>max-peel-times</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARO"></A>
The maximum number of peelings of a single loop.
<DT><B>max-completely-peeled-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARP"></A>
The maximum number of insns of a completely peeled loop.
<DT><B>max-completely-peel-times</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARQ"></A>
The maximum number of iterations of a loop to be suitable for complete peeling.
<DT><B>max-unswitch-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARR"></A>
The maximum number of insns of an unswitched loop.
<DT><B>max-unswitch-level</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARS"></A>
The maximum number of branches unswitched in a single loop.
<DT><B>hot-bb-count-fraction</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixART"></A>
Select fraction of the maximal count of repetitions of basic block in program
given basic block needs to have to be considered hot.
<DT><B>hot-bb-frequency-fraction</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARU"></A>
Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of basic block in
function given basic block needs to have to be considered hot
<DT><B>tracer-dynamic-coverage</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARV"></A>

<DT><B>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARW"></A>

This value is used to limit superblock formation once the given percentage of
executed instructions is covered.  This limits unnecessary code size
expansion.


<P>


The <B>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</B> is used only when profile
feedback is available.  The real profiles (as opposed to statically estimated
ones) are much less balanced allowing the threshold to be larger value.
<DT><B>tracer-max-code-growth</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARX"></A>
Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given percentage.  This is
rather hokey argument, as most of the duplicates will be eliminated later in
cross jumping, so it may be set to much higher values than is the desired code
growth.
<DT><B>tracer-min-branch-ratio</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARY"></A>
Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best edge is less than this
threshold (in percent).
<DT><B>tracer-min-branch-ratio</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixARZ"></A>

<DT><B>tracer-min-branch-ratio-feedback</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASA"></A>

Stop forward growth if the best edge do have probability lower than this
threshold.


<P>


Similarly to <B>tracer-dynamic-coverage</B> two values are present, one for
compilation for profile feedback and one for compilation without.  The value
for compilation with profile feedback needs to be more conservative (higher) in
order to make tracer effective.
<DT><B>max-cse-path-length</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASB"></A>
Maximum number of basic blocks on path that cse considers.
<DT><B>max-last-value-rtl</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASC"></A>
The maximum size measured as number of RTLs that can be recorded in an
expression in combiner for a pseudo register as last known value of that
register.  The default is 10000.
<DT><B>ggc-min-expand</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASD"></A>
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This
parameter specifies the minimum percentage by which the garbage
collector's heap should be allowed to expand between collections.
Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.


<P>


The default is 30% + 70% * (<FONT SIZE="-1">RAM/1GB</FONT>) with an upper bound of 100% when
<FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> &gt;= 1GB.  If <TT>&quot;getrlimit&quot;</TT> is available, the notion of ``<FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT>'' is
the smallest of actual <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">RLIMIT_RSS</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">RLIMIT_DATA</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">RLIMIT_AS</FONT>.  If
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is not able to calculate <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and
<B>ggc-min-heapsize</B> to zero causes a full collection to occur at
every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.
<DT><B>ggc-min-heapsize</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASE"></A>
Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering
to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs after the heap expands
by <B>ggc-min-expand</B>% beyond <B>ggc-min-heapsize</B>.  Again,
tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.


<P>


The default is <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM/8</FONT>, with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an
upper bound of 131072 (128 megabytes).  If <TT>&quot;getrlimit&quot;</TT> is
available, the notion of ``<FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT>'' is the smallest of actual <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT>,
<FONT SIZE="-1">RLIMIT_RSS</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">RLIMIT_DATA</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">RLIMIT_AS</FONT>.  If <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is not able to calculate
<FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> on a particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this
parameter very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting
this parameter and <B>ggc-min-expand</B> to zero causes a full
collection to occur at every opportunity.
<DT><B>max-reload-search-insns</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASF"></A>
The maximum number of instruction reload should look backward for equivalent
register.  Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the
compile time increase with probably slightly better performance.  The default
value is 100.
<DT><B>max-cselib-memory-location</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASG"></A>
The maximum number of memory locations cselib should take into acount.
Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the compile time
increase with probably slightly better performance.  The default value is 500.
<DT><B>reorder-blocks-duplicate</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASH"></A>

<DT><B>reorder-blocks-duplicate-feedback</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixASI"></A>

Used by basic block reordering pass to decide whether to use unconditional
branch or duplicate the code on its destination.  Code is duplicated when its
estimated size is smaller than this value multiplied by the estimated size of
unconditional jump in the hot spots of the program.


<P>


The <B>reorder-block-duplicate-feedback</B> is used only when profile
feedback is available and may be set to higher values than
<B>reorder-block-duplicate</B> since information about the hot spots is more
accurate.
