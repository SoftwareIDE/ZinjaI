This files describes some changes done to the statically compiled version of wxWidgets inside zinjai's binary distributions.

In file src/gtk/toplevel.cpp, in bool wxTopLevelWindowGTK::SetTransparent(wxByte alpha), changed line 1489 from
    Window win = wxGetTopmostWindowX11(dpy, GDK_WINDOW_XID (m_widget->window));
to
    Window win = GDK_WINDOW_XID(m_widget->window);
to avoid a crash when dragging tabs or panels with wxaui. This is a problem with <=2.8.12, not tested in 2.9.
